Summarise your findings here (see specification).

The solve_board function returned false when it was called with the 
mystery2.dat board passed to it suggesting mystery2.dat is the 
"impossible to solve" board. The other two boards were solved rapidly.

The next test was to create a new function where the only difference
was the addition of a pass-by-reference counter. Thus when the boards 
were passed to the new function (solve_board_with_counter), there was a 
method of tracking how many times the function is called during the
recursion. The implication being that the more times the function had to
be called, the more difficult the problem (within reasonable deviations).

Here are the findings summarised (the easy.dat and medium.dat boards are
included for point of reference):

	Sudoku Board	Funtion Calls
	============	=============
	easy.dat			2172
	medium.dat		15662
	mystery1.dat	421547
	mystery3.dat	14134

The mystery1.dat board required far more function calls during the recursion
while mystery3.dat had fewer function calls than the medium.dat board. This
suggests that mystery1.dat is the "extremely hard" board meaning mystery3.dat
must be the board considered "hard".

Conclusion:
	
	Sudoku Board	Difficulty Description
	============	======================
	
	mystery1.dat	"extremely hard"
	
	mystery2.dat	"impossible to solve"
	
	mystery3.dat	"hard"
